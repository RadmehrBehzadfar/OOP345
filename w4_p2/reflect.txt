Authenticity Declaration :
I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that
my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

We developed representations for classes and items – a toy, a child, an order – which served as a means to organise code and model the real world.
And much of the workshop was devoted to the fundamentals of memory management, such as how to do dynamic memory allocation – putting new variables on the heap, using pointers and dynamic arrays – and cleaning up afterwards to keep things safe and free of leaks and crashes.
Copy and move semantics were also discussed in the workshop, revealing ways to efficient manipulate object copies and movements, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.
I also found that operator overloading was pretty cool: we got to redefine +-= and other operators to suit our classes, which made code easier to read.
But writing to and reading from program’s external files was a new concept, and took time to get familiar with.
Most of the time, even with that information, I had to debug my way through problems and figure out pointers one step at a time by trial and error.
As a result, participating in this workshop was a practical exercise that has helped me better understand how I can write C++ code which properly constructs and destroys class instances while following the principles of encapsulation.
